Usage of opensesame [opts] [alphabet]:

	Creates a password by randomly selecting characters from its alphabet.

	Alphabet is a space separated list of character classes to use.
	At least one character in each class will be output.
	Character classes are either literal sets (like "abc" and "123") or the
	names "upper", "lower", "digit", "special" and "default". The "special"
 	alphabet contains characters like "$" and "&" often required by online
 	password guidelines.

	Default alphabet is "upper lower digit special".

	-length int
		length of password to generate (default 12)

$ opensesame --length 4 '123 ABC xyz &%$'
&Cx3
```

## Web server
A web server for random passwords is also included as `open-sesame-web`. [See it online](https://open-sesame-web.herokuapp.com).
